# HotPod

## Overview

Process Manager is a lightweight Go-based process management tool that allows you to start, stop, and manage long-running commands with support for keep-alive functionality. It is designed to run shell commands in a controlled manner and ensure reliability for daemon-like processes.

## Features

- Start and stop processes safely
- Prevent multiple instances of the same process from running
- Graceful shutdown with `SIGTERM`, fallback to `SIGKILL`
- Keep-alive functionality to keep the processes running
- Thread-safe implementation using Goâ€™s sync mechanisms

## Usage

Download the binary from release page.
Run a command using the process manager:

```sh
./hotpod -command "python -m http.server 8000" -shell "sh" -keepalive=true
```
